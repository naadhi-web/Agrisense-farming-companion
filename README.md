# Agrisense-farming-companion


Welcome to the **Agrisense-farming-companion** project! This innovative solution leverages advanced technologies such as machine learning and deep learning to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions to optimize crop selection, disease management, and farming practices.

## Datasets
To implement the **Smart Crop Recommendation System** and **Plant Disease Identification** features, we provide three essential datasets:

### 1. **Crop Recommendation Dataset**
This dataset is used to train the crop recommendation model that suggests optimal crops based on environmental and soil factors. The dataset includes features such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, along with the type of crop that best fits these conditions.

- **Dataset Details:**
  - **Size:** 2200 rows
  - **Features:** Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall
  - **Label:** Crop type (target variable)

### 2. **Plant Disease Identification Dataset**
This dataset is used for training the deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify plant diseases from leaf images. The dataset contains images for 38 different plant diseases across 14 crops.

- **Dataset Details:**
  - **Training Set:** 70,295 images
  - **Validation Set:** 17,572 images
  - **Crops Included:** Apple, Blueberry, Cherry (including sour), Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper (bell), Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato
  - **Diseases Included:** 38 unique plant diseases (e.g., Apple Scab, Tomato Blight, Powdery Mildew)
